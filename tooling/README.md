# How to use this environment.yml with Anaconda.
## A conda environnment for Udacity's PyTorch Challenge.

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your OS if you don't already have it installed.

Download the environment.yml in this folder. You can clone it from this repo or copy it into a text file and save it where you know you can find it.
Open a terminal and navigate to where you saved the file.

Run the command `conda env create -f environment.yml`

This should download some packages. 

You should now be able to `conda activate udacity` and have a fully loaded environment with PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks.

I recomment running `jupyter notebook` to ensure the above was successful.

If you run into any problems please open an issue here or reach out to me in the course Slack!
